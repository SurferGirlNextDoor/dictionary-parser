What in this sense,\nwhen it refers to things, may be used either substantively or\nadjectively; when it refers to persons, it is used only adjectively\nwith a noun expressed, who being the pronoun used substantively.\n\n2.

Bacon.\nTo restrain what power either the devil or any earthly enemy hath to\nwork us woe. Milton.\nWe know what master laid thy keel, What workmen wrought thy ribs of\nsteel.

Hence, the words are\noften used in a general sense with the force of a substantive,\nequivalent to anything you please, a miscellany, a variety, etc. From\nthis arises the name whatnot, applied to an étagère, as being a piece\nof furniture intended for receiving miscellaneous articles of use or\nornament.

The power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the soul by\nwhich it is capable of choosing; the faculty or power of the mind by\nwhich we decide to do or not to do; the power or faculty of\npreferring or selecting one of two or more objects.\nIt is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is meant by the\nword \"volition\" in order to understand the import of the word will,\nfor this last word expresses the power of mind of which \"volition\" is\nthe act. Stewart.\nWill is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for the faculty of\nwilling; sometimes for the act of that faculty, besides [having]\nother meanings. But \"volition\" always signifies the act of willing,\nand nothing else. Reid.\nAppetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is appetite's\ncontroller; what we covet according to the one, by the other we often\nreject. Hooker.\nThe will is plainly that by which the mind chooses anything. J.\nEdwards.\n\n2. The choice which is made; a determination or preference which\nresults from the act or exercise of the power of choice; a volition.\nThe word \"will,\" however, is not always used in this its proper\nacceptation, but is frequently substituted for \"volition\", as when I\nsay that my hand mover in obedience to my will. Stewart.\n\n3. The choice or determination of one who has authority; a decree; a\ncommand; discretionary pleasure.\nThy will be done. Matt. vi. 10.\nOur prayers should be according to the will of God. Law.\n\n4. Strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose.\n\nNote: \"Inclination is another word with which will is frequently\nconfounded. Thus, when the apothecary says, in Romeo and Juliet, --\nMy poverty, but not my will, consents; . . . Put this in any liquid\nthing you will, And drink it off. the word will is plainly used as,\nsynonymous with inclination; not in the strict logical sense, as the\nimmediate antecedent of action. It is with the same latitude that the\nword is used in common conversation, when we speak of doing a thing\nwhich duty prescribes, against one's own will; or when we speak of\ndoing a thing willingly or unwillingly.\" Stewart.\n\n5. That which is strongly wished or desired.\nWhat's your will, good friar Shak.\nThe mariner hath his will. Coleridge.\n\n6. Arbitrary disposal; power to control, dispose, or determine.\nDeliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies. Ps. xxvii. 12.\n\n7\n7 (Law)\n\nDefn: The legal declaration of a person's mind as to the manner in\nwhich he would have his property or estate disposed of after his\ndeath; the written instrument, legally executed, by which a man makes\ndisposition of his estate, to take effect after his death; testament;\ndevise. See the Note under Testament, 1.\n\nNote: Wills are written or nuncupative, that is, oral. See\nNuncupative will, under Nuncupative. At will (Law), at pleasure. To\nhold an estate at the will of another, is to enjoy the possession at\nhis pleasure, and be liable to be ousted at any time by the lessor or\nproprietor. An estate at will is at the will of both parties.\n -- Good will. See under Good.\n -- Ill will, enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence.\n -- To have one's will, to obtain what is desired; to do what one\npleases.\n -- Will worship, worship according to the dictates of the will or\nfancy; formal worship. [Obs.] -- Will worshiper, one who offers will\nworship. [Obs.] Jer. Taylor.\n -- With a will, with willingness and zeal; with all one's heart or\nstrength; earnestly; heartily.",

I\nwol), thou wilt, he will (Obs. he wol); we, ye, they will.] Etym:\n[OE. willen, imp. wolde; akin to OS. willan, OFries. willa, D.\nwillen, G. wollen, OHG. wollan, wellan, Icel. & Sw. vilja, Dan.\nville, Goth. wiljan, OSlav. voliti, L. velle to wish, volo I wish;\ncf. Skr. vrs to choose, to prefer. Cf. Voluntary, Welcome, Well,\nadv.]\n\n1. To wish; to desire; to incline to have.\nA wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should] Wille in effect, but\nas her husband wolde [would]. Chaucer.\nCaleb said unto her, What will thou Judg. i. 14.\nThey would none of my counsel. Prov. i. 30.\n\n2. As an auxiliary, will is used to denote futurity dependent on the\nverb. Thus, in first person, \"I will\" denotes willingness, consent,\npromise; and when \"will\" is emphasized, it denotes determination or\nfixed purpose; as, I will go if you wish; I will go at all hazards.\nIn the second and third persons, the idea of distinct volition, wish,\nor purpose is evanescent, and simple certainty is appropriately\nexpressed; as, \"You will go,\" or \"He will go,\" describes a future\nevent as a fact only. To emphasize will denotes (according to the\ntone or context) certain futurity or fixed determination.\n\nNote: Will, auxiliary, may be used elliptically for will go. \"I'll to\nher lodgings.\" Marlowe.\n\nNote: As in shall (which see), the second and third persons may be\nvirtually converted into the first, either by question or indirect\nstatement, so as to receive the meaning which belongs to will in that\nperson; thus, \"Will you go\" (answer, \"I will go\") asks assent,\nrequests, etc.; while \"Will he go\" simply inquires concerning\nfuturity; thus, also,\"He says or thinks he will go,\" \"You say or\nthink you will go,\" both signify willingness or consent.\n\nNote: Would, as the preterit of will, is chiefly employed in\nconditional, subjunctive, or optative senses; as, he would go if he\ncould; he could go if he would; he said that he would go; I would\nfain go, but can not; I would that I were young again; and other like\nphrases. In the last use, the first personal pronoun is often\nomitted; as, would that he were here; would to Heaven that it were\nso; and, omitting the to in such an adjuration. \"Would God I had died\nfor thee.\" Would is used for both present and future time, in\nconditional propositions, and would have for past time; as, he would\ngo now if he were ready; if it should rain, he would not go; he would\nhave gone, had he been able. Would not, as also will not, signifies\nrefusal. \"He was angry, and would not go in.\" Luke xv. 28. Would is\nnever a past participle.\n\nNote: In Ireland, Scotland, and the United States, especially in the\nsouthern and western portions of the United States, shall and will,\nshould and would, are often misused, as in the following examples: --\nI am able to devote as much time and attention to other subjects as I\nwill [shall] be under the necessity of doing next winter. Chalmers.\nA countryman, telling us what he had seen, remarked that if the\nconflagration went on, as it was doing, we would [should] have, as\nour next season's employment, the Old Town of Edinburgh to rebuild.\nH.

Prudence (that\nis, providence, or forecast) is of a more negative character; it\nrather consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive measures\nfor the accomplishment of an object. Sir Robert Walpole was in many\nrespects a prudent statesman, but he was far from being a wise one.\nBurke has said that prudence, when carried too far, degenerates into\na \"reptile virtue,\" which is the more dangerous for its plausible\nappearance. Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the\nsimple apprehension of facts or relations. \"In strictness of\nlanguage,\" says Paley, \" there is a difference between knowledge and\nwisdom; wisdom always supposing action, and action directed by it.\"\nKnowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have ofttimes no\nconnection. Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other\nmen; Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge, a rude,\nunprofitable mass, The mere materials with which wisdom builds, Till\nsmoothed, and squared, and fitted to its place, Does but encumber\nwhom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so\nmuch; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.

Humor is a quality more congenial to the English mind than wit.\nIt consists primarily in taking up the peculiarities of a humorist\n(or eccentric person) and drawing them out, as Addison did those of\nSir Roger de Coverley, so that we enjoy a hearty, good-natured laugh\nat his unconscious manifestation of whims and oddities. From this\noriginal sense the term has been widened to embrace other sources of\nkindly mirth of the same general character. In a well-known\ncaricature of English reserve, an Oxford student is represented as\nstanding on the brink of a river, greatly agitated at the sight of a\ndrowning man before him, and crying out, \"O that I had been\nintroduced to this gentleman, that I might save his life!

The various styles of wrestling differ in their\ndefinition of a fall and in the governing rules. In Greco-Roman\nwrestling, tripping and taking hold of the legs are forbidden, and a\nfall is gained (that is, the bout is won), by the contestant who pins\nboth his opponent's shoulders to the ground. In catch-as-catch-can\nwrestling, all holds are permitted except such as may be barred by\nmutual consent, and a fall is defined as in Greco-Roman style.\nLancashire style wrestling is essentially the same as catch-as-catch-\ncan. In Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling the contestants stand\nchest to chest, grasping each other around the body. The one first\nlosing his hold, or touching the ground with any part of his body\nexcept his feet, loses the bout. If both fall to the ground at the\nsame time, it is a dogfall, and must be wrestled over. In the\nCornwall and Devon wrestling, the wrestlers complete in strong loose\nlinen jackets, catching hold of the jacket, or anywhere above the\nwaist. Two shoulders and one hip, or two hips and one shoulder, must\ntouch the ground to constitute a fall, and if a man is thrown\notherwise than on his back the contestants get upon their feet and\nthe bout recommences.",

In former\nEnglish law and practice, writs in civil cases were either original\nor judicial; the former were issued out of the Court of Chancery,\nunder the great seal, for the summoning of a defendant to appear, and\nwere granted before the suit began and in order to begin the same;\nthe latter were issued out of the court where the original was\nreturned, after the suit was begun and during the pendency of it.\nTomlins.
