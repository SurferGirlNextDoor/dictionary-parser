      "W\nW\n\nDefn: W, the twenty-third letter of the English alphabet, is usually\na consonant, but sometimes it is a vowel, forming the second element\nof certain diphthongs, as in few, how. It takes its written form and\nits name from the repetition of a V, this being the original form of\nthe Roman capital letter which we call U. Etymologically it is most\nrelated to v and u. See V, and U. Some of the uneducated classes in\nEngland, especially in London, confuse w and v, substituting the one\nfor the other, as weal for veal, and veal for weal; wine for vine,\nand vine for wine, etc. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 266-268."

The quality of being heavy; that property of bodies by which they\ntend toward the center of the earth; the effect of gravitative force,\nespecially when expressed in certain units or standards, as pounds,\ngrams, etc.\n\nNote: Weight differs from gravity in being the effect of gravity, or\nthe downward pressure of a body under the influence of gravity;\nhence, it constitutes a measure of the force of gravity, and being\nthe resultant of all the forces exerted by gravity upon the different\nparticles of the body, it is proportional to the quantity of matter\nin the body.\n\n2. The quantity of heaviness; comparative tendency to the center of\nthe earth; the quantity of matter as estimated by the balance, or\nexpressed numerically with reference to some standard unit; as, a\nmass of stone having the weight of five hundred pounds.\nFor sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell, Once set on ringing, with his\nown weight goes. Shak.\n\n3. Hence, pressure; burden; as, the weight of care or business. \"The\nweight of this said time.\" Shak.\nFor the public all this weight he bears. Milton.\n[He] who singly bore the world's sad weight. Keble.\n\n4. Importance; power; influence; efficacy; consequence; moment;\nimpressiveness; as, a consideration of vast weight.\nIn such a point of weight, so near mine honor. Shak.\n\n5. A scale, or graduated standard, of heaviness; a mode of estimating\nweight; as, avoirdupois weight; troy weight; apothecaries' weight.\n\n6. A ponderous mass; something heavy; as, a clock weight; a paper\nweight.\nA man leapeth better with weights in his hands. Bacon.\n\n7. A definite mass of iron, lead, brass, or other metal, to be used\nfor ascertaining the weight of other bodies; as, an ounce weight.\n\n8. (Mech.)\n\nDefn: The resistance against which a machine acts, as opposed to the\npower which moves it. [Obs.] Atomic weight. (Chem.) See under Atomic,\nand cf. Element.\n -- Dead weight, Feather weight, Heavy weight, Light weight, etc. See\nunder Dead, Feather, etc.\n -- Weight of observation (Astron. & Physics), a number expressing\nthe most probable relative value of each observation in determining\nthe result of a series of observations of the same kind.\n\nSyn.\n -- Ponderousness; gravity; heaviness; pressure; burden; load;\nimportance; power; influence; efficacy; consequence; moment;\nimpressiveness.",
      "WEIGHT\nWeight, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Weighted; p. pr. & vb. n. Weighting.]\n\n1.

Etym: [AS. hwæt, neuter of hwa who; akin to\nOS. hwat what, OFries. hwet, D. & LG. wat, G. was, OHG. waz, hwaz,\nIcel. hvat, Sw. & Dan. hvad, Goth. hwa. sq. root182. See Who.]\n\n1. As an interrogative pronoun, used in asking questions regarding\neither persons or things; as, what is this what did you say what poem\nis this what child is lost\nWhat see'st thou in the ground Shak.\nWhat is man, that thou art mindful of him Ps. viii. 4.\nWhat manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!\nMatt. viii. 27.\n\nNote: Originally, what, when, where, which, who, why, etc., were\ninterrogatives only, and it is often difficult to determine whether\nthey are used as interrogatives or relatives. What in this sense,\nwhen it refers to things, may be used either substantively or\nadjectively; when it refers to persons, it is used only adjectively\nwith a noun expressed, who being the pronoun used substantively.\n\n2. As an exclamatory word: -- (a) Used absolutely or independently; -\n- often with a question following. \"What welcome be thou.\" Chaucer.\nWhat, could ye not watch with me one hour Matt. xxvi. 40.\n\n(b) Used adjectively, meaning how remarkable, or how great; as, what\nfolly! what eloquence! what courage!\nWhat a piece of work is man! Shak.\nO what a riddle of absurdity! Young.\n\nNote: What in this use has a or an between itself and its noun if the\nqualitative or quantitative importance of the object is emphasized.\n(c) Sometimes prefixed to adjectives in an adverbial sense, as nearly\nequivalent to how; as, what happy boys!\nWhat partial judges are our and hate! Dryden.\n\n3. As a relative pronoun: --\n(a) Used substantively with the antecedent suppressed, equivalent to\nthat which, or those [persons] who, or those [things] which; --\ncalled a compound relative.\nWith joy beyond what victory bestows. Cowper.\nI'm thinking Captain Lawton will count the noses of what are left\nbefore they see their whaleboats. Cooper.\nWhat followed was in perfect harmony with this beginning. Macaulay.\nI know well . . . how little you will be disposed to criticise what\ncomes to you from me. J. H. Newman.\n\n(b) Used adjectively, equivalent to the . . . which; the sort or kind\nof . . . which; rarely, the . . . on, or at, which.\nSee what natures accompany what colors. Bacon.\nTo restrain what power either the devil or any earthly enemy hath to\nwork us woe. Milton.\nWe know what master laid thy keel, What workmen wrought thy ribs of\nsteel. Longfellow.\n\n(c) Used adverbially in a sense corresponding to the adjectival use;\nas, he picked what good fruit he saw.\n\n4. Whatever; whatsoever; what thing soever; -- used indefinitely.\n\"What after so befall.\" Chaucer.\nWhether it were the shortness of his foresight, the strength of his\nwill, . . . or what it was. Bacon.\n\n5. Used adverbially, in part; partly; somewhat; -- with a following\npreposition, especially, with, and commonly with repetition.\nWhat for lust [pleasure] and what for lore. Chaucer.\nThus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows,\nand what with poverty, I am custom shrunk. Shak.\nThe year before he had so used the matter that what by force, what by\npolicy, he had taken from the Christians above thirty small castles.\nKnolles.\n\nNote: In such phrases as I tell you what, what anticipates the\nfollowing statement, being elliptical for what I think, what it is,\nhow it is, etc. \"I tell thee what, corporal Bardolph, I could tear\nher.\" Shak. Here what relates to the last clause, \"I could tear her;\"\nthis is what I tell you. What not is often used at the close of an\nenumeration of several particulars or articles, it being an\nabbreviated clause, the verb of which, being either the same as that\nof the principal clause or a general word, as be, say, mention,\nenumerate, etc., is omitted. \"Men hunt, hawk, and what not.\" Becon.\n\"Some dead puppy, or log, orwhat not.\" C. Kingsley. \"Battles,\ntournaments, hunts, and what not.\" De Quincey. Hence, the words are\noften used in a general sense with the force of a substantive,\nequivalent to anything you please, a miscellany, a variety, etc. From\nthis arises the name whatnot, applied to an étagère, as being a piece\nof furniture intended for receiving miscellaneous articles of use or\nornament. But what is used for but that, usually after a negative,\nand excludes everything contrary to the assertion in the following\nsentence. \"Her needle is not so absolutely perfect in tent and cross\nstitch but what my superintendence is advisable.\" Sir W. Scott.\n\"Never fear but what our kite shall fly as high.\" Ld. Lytton. What\nho! an exclamation of calling.\n -- What if, what will it matter if; what will happen or be the\nresult if. \"What if it be a poison\" Shak.\n -- What of this that it etc., what follows from this, that, it,\netc., often with the implication that it is of no consequence. \"All\nthis is so; but what of this, my lord\" Shak. \"The night is spent,\nwhy, what of that\" Shak.\n -- What though, even granting that; allowing that; supposing it true\nthat. \"What though the rose have prickles, yet't is plucked.\" Shak.\n -- What time, or What time as, when. [Obs. or Archaic] \"What time I\nam afraid, I will trust in thee.\" Ps. lvi. 3.\nWhat time the morn mysterious visions brings. Pope.",

      "WHAT\nWhat, interrog. adv.\n\nDefn: Why For what purpose On what account [Obs.]\nWhat should I tell the answer of the knight. Chaucer.\nBut what do I stand reckoning upon advantages and gains lost by the\nmisrule and turbulency of the prelates What do I pick up so thriftily\ntheir scatterings and diminishings of the meaner subject Milton."

The\ncriminal was then unbound, and laid on a small wheel, with his face\nupward, and his arms and legs doubled under him, there to expire, if\nhe had survived the previous treatment.

      "WILL\nWill, n. Etym: [OE. wille, AS. willa; akin to OFries. willa, OS.\nwilleo, willio, D. wil, G. wille, Icel. vili, Dan. villie, Sw. vilja,\nGoth wilja. See Will, v.]\n\n1. The power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the soul by\nwhich it is capable of choosing; the faculty or power of the mind by\nwhich we decide to do or not to do; the power or faculty of\npreferring or selecting one of two or more objects.\nIt is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is meant by the\nword \"volition\" in order to understand the import of the word will,\nfor this last word expresses the power of mind of which \"volition\" is\nthe act. Stewart.\nWill is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for the faculty of\nwilling; sometimes for the act of that faculty, besides [having]\nother meanings. But \"volition\" always signifies the act of willing,\nand nothing else. Reid.\nAppetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is appetite's\ncontroller; what we covet according to the one, by the other we often\nreject. Hooker.\nThe will is plainly that by which the mind chooses anything. J.\nEdwards.\n\n2. The choice which is made; a determination or preference which\nresults from the act or exercise of the power of choice; a volition.\nThe word \"will,\" however, is not always used in this its proper\nacceptation, but is frequently substituted for \"volition\", as when I\nsay that my hand mover in obedience to my will. Stewart.\n\n3. The choice or determination of one who has authority; a decree; a\ncommand; discretionary pleasure.\nThy will be done. Matt. vi. 10.\nOur prayers should be according to the will of God. Law.\n\n4. Strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose.\n\nNote: \"Inclination is another word with which will is frequently\nconfounded. Thus, when the apothecary says, in Romeo and Juliet, --\nMy poverty, but not my will, consents; . . . Put this in any liquid\nthing you will, And drink it off. the word will is plainly used as,\nsynonymous with inclination; not in the strict logical sense, as the\nimmediate antecedent of action. It is with the same latitude that the\nword is used in common conversation, when we speak of doing a thing\nwhich duty prescribes, against one's own will; or when we speak of\ndoing a thing willingly or unwillingly.\" Stewart.\n\n5. That which is strongly wished or desired.\nWhat's your will, good friar Shak.\nThe mariner hath his will. Coleridge.\n\n6. Arbitrary disposal; power to control, dispose, or determine.\nDeliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies. Ps. xxvii. 12.\n\n7\n7 (Law)\n\nDefn: The legal declaration of a person's mind as to the manner in\nwhich he would have his property or estate disposed of after his\ndeath; the written instrument, legally executed, by which a man makes\ndisposition of his estate, to take effect after his death; testament;\ndevise. See the Note under Testament, 1.\n\nNote: Wills are written or nuncupative, that is, oral. See\nNuncupative will, under Nuncupative. At will (Law), at pleasure. To\nhold an estate at the will of another, is to enjoy the possession at\nhis pleasure, and be liable to be ousted at any time by the lessor or\nproprietor. An estate at will is at the will of both parties.\n -- Good will. See under Good.\n -- Ill will, enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence.\n -- To have one's will, to obtain what is desired; to do what one\npleases.\n -- Will worship, worship according to the dictates of the will or\nfancy; formal worship. [Obs.] -- Will worshiper, one who offers will\nworship. [Obs.] Jer. Taylor.\n -- With a will, with willingness and zeal; with all one's heart or\nstrength; earnestly; heartily.",
      "WILL\nWill, v. t. & auxiliary. [imp. Would. Indic. present, I will (Obs. I\nwol), thou wilt, he will (Obs. he wol); we, ye, they will.] Etym:\n[OE. willen, imp. wolde; akin to OS. willan, OFries. willa, D.\nwillen, G. wollen, OHG. wollan, wellan, Icel. & Sw. vilja, Dan.\nville, Goth. wiljan, OSlav. voliti, L. velle to wish, volo I wish;\ncf. Skr. vrs to choose, to prefer. Cf. Voluntary, Welcome, Well,\nadv.]\n\n1. To wish; to desire; to incline to have.\nA wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should] Wille in effect, but\nas her husband wolde [would]. Chaucer.\nCaleb said unto her, What will thou Judg. i. 14.\nThey would none of my counsel. Prov. i. 30.\n\n2. As an auxiliary, will is used to denote futurity dependent on the\nverb. Thus, in first person, \"I will\" denotes willingness, consent,\npromise; and when \"will\" is emphasized, it denotes determination or\nfixed purpose; as, I will go if you wish; I will go at all hazards.\nIn the second and third persons, the idea of distinct volition, wish,\nor purpose is evanescent, and simple certainty is appropriately\nexpressed; as, \"You will go,\" or \"He will go,\" describes a future\nevent as a fact only. To emphasize will denotes (according to the\ntone or context) certain futurity or fixed determination.\n\nNote: Will, auxiliary, may be used elliptically for will go. \"I'll to\nher lodgings.\" Marlowe.\n\nNote: As in shall (which see), the second and third persons may be\nvirtually converted into the first, either by question or indirect\nstatement, so as to receive the meaning which belongs to will in that\nperson; thus, \"Will you go\" (answer, \"I will go\") asks assent,\nrequests, etc.; while \"Will he go\" simply inquires concerning\nfuturity; thus, also,\"He says or thinks he will go,\" \"You say or\nthink you will go,\" both signify willingness or consent.\n\nNote: Would, as the preterit of will, is chiefly employed in\nconditional, subjunctive, or optative senses; as, he would go if he\ncould; he could go if he would; he said that he would go; I would\nfain go, but can not; I would that I were young again; and other like\nphrases. In the last use, the first personal pronoun is often\nomitted; as, would that he were here; would to Heaven that it were\nso; and, omitting the to in such an adjuration. \"Would God I had died\nfor thee.\" Would is used for both present and future time, in\nconditional propositions, and would have for past time; as, he would\ngo now if he were ready; if it should rain, he would not go; he would\nhave gone, had he been able. Would not, as also will not, signifies\nrefusal. \"He was angry, and would not go in.\" Luke xv. 28. Would is\nnever a past participle.\n\nNote: In Ireland, Scotland, and the United States, especially in the\nsouthern and western portions of the United States, shall and will,\nshould and would, are often misused, as in the following examples: --\nI am able to devote as much time and attention to other subjects as I\nwill [shall] be under the necessity of doing next winter. Chalmers.\nA countryman, telling us what he had seen, remarked that if the\nconflagration went on, as it was doing, we would [should] have, as\nour next season's employment, the Old Town of Edinburgh to rebuild.\nH. Miller.\nI feel assured that I will [shall] not have the misfortune to find\nconflicting views held by one so enlightened as your excellency. J.\nY. Mason.",
      "WILL\nWill, v. i.\n\nDefn: To be willing; to be inclined or disposed; to be pleased; to\nwish; to desire.\nAnd behold, there came a leper and worshiped him, saying, Lord if\nthou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus . . . touched him,\nsaying, I will; be thou clean. Matt. viii. 2, 3.\n\nNote: This word has been confused with will, v. i., to choose, which,\nunlike this, is of the weak conjugation. Will I, nill I, or Will ye,\nhill ye, or Will he, nill he, whether I, you, or he will it or not;\nhence, without choice; compulsorily; -- sometimes corrupted into\nwilly nilly. \"If I must take service willy nilly.\" J. H. Newman.\n\"Land for all who would till it, and reading and writing will ye,\nnill ye.\" Lowell.",
      "WILL\nWill, v. t. [imp. & p. p Willed; p. pr. & vb. n. Willing. Indic.\npresent I will, thou willeth, he wills; we, ye, they will.] Etym:\n[Cf. AS. willian. See Will, n.]\n\n1. To form a distinct volition of; to determine by an act of choice;\nto ordain; to decree. \"What she will to do or say.\" Milton.\nBy all law and reason, that which the Parliament will not, is no more\nestablished in this kingdom. Milton.\nTwo things he [God] willeth, that we should be good, and that we\nshould be happy. Barrow.\n\n2. To enjoin or command, as that which is determined by an act of\nvolition; to direct; to order. [Obs. or R.]\nThey willed me say so, madam. Shak.\nSend for music, And will the cooks to use their best of cunning To\nplease the palate. Beau. & Fl.\nAs you go, will the lord mayor . . . To attend our further pleasure\npresently. J. Webster.\n\n3. To give or direct the disposal of by testament; to bequeath; to\ndevise; as, to will one's estate to a child; also, to order or direct\nby testament; as, he willed that his nephew should have his watch.",
      "WILL\nWill, v. i.\n\nDefn: To exercise an act of volition; to choose; to decide; to\ndetermine; to decree.\nAt Winchester he lies, so himself willed. Robert of Brunne.\nHe that shall turn his thoughts inward upon what passes in his own\nmind when he wills. Locke.\nI contend for liberty as it signifies a power in man to do as he\nwills or pleases. Collins."

The quality of being wise; knowledge, and the capacity to make due\nuse of it; knowledge of the best ends and the best means; discernment\nand judgment; discretion; sagacity; skill; dexterity.\nWe speak also not in wise words of man's wisdom, but in the doctrine\nof the spirit. Wyclif (1 Cor. ii. 13).\nBehold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil\nis understanding. Job xxviii. 28.\nIt is hoped that our rulers will act with dignity and wisdom that\nthey will yield everything to reason, and refuse everything to force.\nAmes.\nCommon sense in an uncommon degree is what the world calls wisdom.\nColeridge.\n\n2. The results of wise judgments; scientific or practical truth;\nacquired knowledge; erudition.\nMoses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty\nin words and in deeds. Acts vii. 22.\n\nSyn.\n -- Prudence; knowledge. Wisdom, Prudence, Knowledge. Wisdom has been\ndefined to be \"the use of the best means for attaining the best\nends.\" \"We conceive,\" says Whewell, \" prudence as the virtue by which\nwe select right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the\nselection of right ends as well as of right means.\" Hence, wisdom\nimplies the union of high mental and moral excellence. Prudence (that\nis, providence, or forecast) is of a more negative character; it\nrather consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive measures\nfor the accomplishment of an object. Sir Robert Walpole was in many\nrespects a prudent statesman, but he was far from being a wise one.\nBurke has said that prudence, when carried too far, degenerates into\na \"reptile virtue,\" which is the more dangerous for its plausible\nappearance. Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the\nsimple apprehension of facts or relations. \"In strictness of\nlanguage,\" says Paley, \" there is a difference between knowledge and\nwisdom; wisdom always supposing action, and action directed by it.\"\nKnowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have ofttimes no\nconnection. Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other\nmen; Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge, a rude,\nunprofitable mass, The mere materials with which wisdom builds, Till\nsmoothed, and squared, and fitted to its place, Does but encumber\nwhom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so\nmuch; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more. Cowper.\nWisdom tooth, the last, or back, tooth of the full set on each half\nof each jaw in man; -- familiarly so called, because appearing\ncomparatively late, after the person may be supposed to have arrived\nat the age of wisdom. See the Note under Tooth, 1."

      "WIT\nWit, n. Etym: [AS. witt, wit; akin to OFries. wit, G. witz, OHG.\nwizzi, Icel. vit, Dan. vid, Sw. vett. sq. root133. See Wit, v.]\n\n1. Mind; intellect; understanding; sense.\nWho knew the wit of the Lord or who was his counselor Wyclif (Rom.\nxi. 34).\nA prince most prudent, of an excellent And unmatched wit and\njudgment. Shak.\nWill puts in practice what wit deviseth. Sir J. Davies.\nHe wants not wit the dander to decline. Dryden.\n\n2. A mental faculty, or power of the mind; -- used in this sense\nchiefly in the plural, and in certain phrases; as, to lose one's\nwits; at one's wits' end, and the like. \"Men's wittes ben so dull.\"\nChaucer.\nI will stare him out of his wits. Shak.\n\n3. Felicitous association of objects not usually connected, so as to\nproduce a pleasant surprise; also. the power of readily combining\nobjects in such a manner.\nThe definition of wit is only this, that it is a propriety of\nthoughts and words; or, in other terms, thoughts and words elegantly\nadapted to the subject. Dryden.\nWit which discovers partial likeness hidden in general diversity.\nColeridge.\nWit lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together\nwith quickness and variety wherein can be found any resemblance or\ncongruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures in the fancy. Locke.\n\n4. A person of eminent sense or knowledge; a man of genius, fancy, or\nhumor; one distinguished for bright or amusing sayings, for repartee,\nand the like.\nIn Athens, where books and wits were ever busier than in any other\npart of Greece, I find but only two sorts of writings which the\nmagistrate cared to take notice of; those either blasphemous and\natheistical, or libelous. Milton.\nIntemperate wits will spare neither friend nor foe. L'Estrange.\nA wit herself, Amelia weds a wit. Young.\nThe five wits, the five senses; also, sometimes, the five qualities\nor faculties, common wit, imagination, fantasy, estimation, and\nmemory. Chaucer. Nares.\nBut my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart\nfrom serving thee. Shak.\n\nSyn.\n -- Ingenuity; humor; satire; sarcasm; irony; burlesque.\n -- Wit, Humor. Wit primarily meant mind; and now denotes the power\nof seizing on some thought or occurrence, and, by a sudden turn,\npresenting it under aspects wholly new and unexpected -- apparently\nnatural and admissible, if not perfectly just, and bearing on the\nsubject, or the parties concerned, with a laughable keenness and\nforce. \"What I want,\" said a pompous orator, aiming at his\nantagonist, \"is common sense.\" \"Exactly!\" was the whispered reply.\nThe pleasure we find in wit arises from the ingenuity of the turn,\nthe sudden surprise it brings, and the patness of its application to\nthe case, in the new and ludicrous relations thus flashed upon the\nview. Humor is a quality more congenial to the English mind than wit.\nIt consists primarily in taking up the peculiarities of a humorist\n(or eccentric person) and drawing them out, as Addison did those of\nSir Roger de Coverley, so that we enjoy a hearty, good-natured laugh\nat his unconscious manifestation of whims and oddities. From this\noriginal sense the term has been widened to embrace other sources of\nkindly mirth of the same general character. In a well-known\ncaricature of English reserve, an Oxford student is represented as\nstanding on the brink of a river, greatly agitated at the sight of a\ndrowning man before him, and crying out, \"O that I had been\nintroduced to this gentleman, that I might save his life! The,\n\"Silent Woman\" of Ben Jonson is one of the most humorous productions,\nin the original sense of the term, which we have in our language."

Cf. Zounds.]\n\n1. A hurt or injury caused by violence; specifically, a breach of the\nskin and flesh of an animal, or in the substance of any creature or\nliving thing; a cut, stab, rent, or the like. Chaucer.\nShowers of blood Rained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen.\nShak.\n\n2. Fig.: An injury, hurt, damage, detriment, or the like, to feeling,\nfaculty, reputation, etc.\n\n3. (Criminal Law)\n\nDefn: An injury to the person by which the skin is divided, or its\ncontinuity broken; a lesion of the body, involving some solution of\ncontinuity.\n\nNote: Walker condemns the pronunciation woond as a \"capricious\nnovelty.\" It is certainly opposed to an important principle of our\nlanguage, namely, that the Old English long sound written ou, and\npronounced like French ou or modern English oo, has regularly\nchanged, when accented, into the diphthongal sound usually written\nwith the same letters ou in modern English, as in ground, hound,\nround, sound. The use of ou in Old English to represent the sound of\nmodern English oo was borrowed from the French, and replaced the\nolder and Anglo-Saxon spelling with u. It makes no difference whether\nthe word was taken from the French or not, provided it is old enough\nin English to have suffered this change to what is now the common\nsound of ou; but words taken from the French at a later time, or\ninfluenced by French, may have the French sound. Wound gall (Zoöl.),\nan elongated swollen or tuberous gall on the branches of the\ngrapevine, caused by a small reddish brown weevil (Ampeloglypter\nsesostris) whose larvæ inhabit the galls.",

      "WRESTLING\nWres\"tling, n.\n\nDefn: Act of one who wrestles; specif., the sport consisting of the\nhand-to-hand combat between two unarmed contestants who seek to throw\neach other. The various styles of wrestling differ in their\ndefinition of a fall and in the governing rules. In Greco-Roman\nwrestling, tripping and taking hold of the legs are forbidden, and a\nfall is gained (that is, the bout is won), by the contestant who pins\nboth his opponent's shoulders to the ground. In catch-as-catch-can\nwrestling, all holds are permitted except such as may be barred by\nmutual consent, and a fall is defined as in Greco-Roman style.\nLancashire style wrestling is essentially the same as catch-as-catch-\ncan. In Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling the contestants stand\nchest to chest, grasping each other around the body. The one first\nlosing his hold, or touching the ground with any part of his body\nexcept his feet, loses the bout. If both fall to the ground at the\nsame time, it is a dogfall, and must be wrestled over. In the\nCornwall and Devon wrestling, the wrestlers complete in strong loose\nlinen jackets, catching hold of the jacket, or anywhere above the\nwaist. Two shoulders and one hip, or two hips and one shoulder, must\ntouch the ground to constitute a fall, and if a man is thrown\notherwise than on his back the contestants get upon their feet and\nthe bout recommences."
